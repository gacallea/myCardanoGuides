# Guides For Cardano Pool Ops #

Hereby collected, in chronological order, my humble contributions to the Cardano ecosystem. A set of detailed guides, with custom scripts, to help you install, configure, manage, automate, and monitor a Cardano pool. The system used in the guides is now the latest Ubuntu [20.04 LTS](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/ubuntu-help/index.html).

## Not Another Cardano Guide ##

```Not Another Cardano Guide``` it's a guide that will help you setup a **single-Jormungandr-node** pool. ```NACG``` set of scripts is available [here](https://github.com/gacallea/nacg/).

## ITN1 Cluster ##

```ITN1 Cluster``` it's a guide that will help you setup a **three-Jormungandr-nodes** cluster pool **on the same server**. ```ITN1 Cluster``` set of scripts is available [here](https://github.com/gacallea/itn1_cluster/).

If you are not familiar with Creative Commons licenses, here's a bit [I wrote about them](https://gacallea.info/posts/a-primer-on-linux-open-source-and-copyleft-hackers-included/#creative-commons) that clarify what Creative Commons licenses are about.

## Assumptions ##

It would be impossible to cover every single scenario that a user could come up with, therefore the guides makes some assumptions during the process of installation and in the provided set of scripts. Examples and default values are provided, both in the guide and in the configuration files. It would still be possible for you to change the values of course. However, if unsure, sticking with the provided defaults is a safe choice. Should you decide to make changes, they should adhere to the same underlying logic of the default values. Otherwise the installation could fail or be troublesome.

## Updates ##

Updates are implemented only after they have been tested on my pool. Sections are added to the guide as needed. The same goes for useful features in the pool management scripts.
